Cracking the Coding Interview
==============================
1- _1_1_IsUnique: Space: O(N) => Space: O(1) Because 128 is a constant number and the string can be more than 128 (number of characters in ASCII).
2- _1_2_CheckPermutation: The answer of the solution for the sorting method is more modeler and shorter the my method.
3- _1_5_OneWay: You can use the index of the strings instead of making new booleans.
